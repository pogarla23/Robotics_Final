## TENNIS BALL COLLECTOR

### Teammates:
- Daniel Arabie (Computer Engineering '27)
- Gabriel Freedman (Mechanical Engineering '26)
- Pooja Garlapati (Computer Engineering '27)

### Overview:
Final Project for ENGR 3100.  
This project uses an Arduino-controlled robot equipped with a Pixy2 camera, a ultrasonic sensor, three omni-directional wheels, and a servo-driven claw to autonomously detect and collect tennis balls on a court. The robot uses a simple search-and-track algorithm to locate tennis balls and navigate towards them.

## Materials
- Arduino Uno
- Pixy2 Camera
- Ultrasonic Sensor for Arudinos
- 3 omni-directional wheels with servo motors (dk type of driver)
- standard servo for claw
- Chassis for mounting wheels and claw
- Battery pack
- connectors/mounting brackets
